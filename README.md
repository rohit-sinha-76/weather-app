# Weather App

A simple, single-page weather app that pulls current weather and a 7-day forecast from OpenWeatherMap. It’s got a sleek glassmorphism design with sky blue gradients that shift based on the weather—pretty neat, right?

## Features
- Search for any city to see temp, humidity, wind, and more.
- 7-day forecast with daily highs and lows.
- Dynamic background that matches the weather vibe.
- Fits on one screen, no scrolling needed.

## Setup
1. Clone this repo or grab the files: `index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`.
2. Open `index.html` in a browser—works out of the box since it uses a public API key.
3. Make sure you’re online; it pulls data from OpenWeatherMap.

## Usage
- Type a city name in the search bar and hit Enter or click the magnifying glass.
- Watch the background change and the weather info pop in.
- Starts with Delhi by default—just refresh to see it load.

## Notes
- The API key’s hardcoded in `script.js`. If you’re deploying this for real, swap it to a backend or env variable for security.
- Built with HTML, CSS, and vanilla JS—no frameworks, just pure fun.

Enjoy checking the weather in style!
